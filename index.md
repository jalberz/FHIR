# About

As FHIR increases the interoperability of health record systems, care should be taken as new implementations are established. These systems may not have universal security standards (as outlined in FHIR’s own [security overview](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/security.html)).

 What can developers do to insure that patient data is protected? What education should both developers and healthcare professionals understand about the expectations and limitations of their counterparts’ field?

 **Current Policy/Ethical Issues with FHIR**

The current FHIR standard has delegated responsibilities for security standards largely to implementer preference, possibly due to pressure to spur FHIR adoption and ease of deployment
Without compliance certification, FHIR servers without sufficient security measures can put patient data at risk - particularly in poorer, vulnerable areas where institutions might not have the time or resources to get FHIR implementation right
What is the division of responsibility between standards setters vs implementers when it comes HIPAA?
